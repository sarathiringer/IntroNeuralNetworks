# Intro to Neural Networks
Materials for learning the very basics of neural networks, used on the Pink Programming Online Summer Camp on Deep Learning in 2021.

## Folder Solution Notebooks
In this folder, you'll find notebooks with complete instructions and code for maunally building a small neural network and solving the XOR problem, looking at how to minimize functions, learning some common acitvation functions and trying out Keras.

## Folder Code Along Notebooks
These notebooks have text and comments, but not code. Use them to code along from the solutions to practice coding!

## Notebooks
* 1. Introduction to a neural network
In this notebook, we manually code a neural network to solve the XOR problem. No actual (machine) "learning" in this part.

* 2. Optimizing the parameters in an efficient way
This notebook inspects some different functions and what we mean by minimizing them. It also theoretically introduces Stochstic Gradient Descent. 

* 3. Activation functions
Introduction to three common activation functions - ReLU, sigmoid and smooth ReLU.

* 4. Build a neural network with Keras
In this notebook, we use Keras to try out the all the stuff that we previously coded manually. We use it on a regression task on the Abalone dataset.
